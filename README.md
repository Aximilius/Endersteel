# Endersteel v1.0.0.0
By: Aximilius

My first foray into Minecraft modding, Endersteel is a vanilla-adjacent mod that adds an End-based endgame material to the game.

# Instructions
Download the "endersteel-1.19.4-1.0.0.0.jar" file and add it to your mods folder

Endersteel Deposits can be found throughout the end in extremely rare veins of 1-3 deposits. Endersteel Deposits will drop 1 raw endersteel, which you can combine with a netherite block in a smithing table to get a Galvanized Endersteel Ingot. Use this in a smithing table to upgrade your netherite armor, weapons, and tools into even stronger variants.
